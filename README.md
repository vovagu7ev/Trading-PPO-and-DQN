# Reinforcement Learning for Cryptocurrency Trading Strategies

## Overview

This project explores the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to develop and fine-tune trading strategies for cryptocurrencies, focusing specifically on Bitcoin. We investigate two prominent RL algorithms: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Q-Network (DQN), training agents using historical Bitcoin price data within a simulated trading environment. 

## Key Objectives 

* Applying RL to Cryptocurrency Trading: Utilize PPO and DQN to develop profitable trading strategies for Bitcoin.
* Performance Evaluation: Compare the performances of PPO and DQN in terms of cumulative rewards, stability, consistency, and training efficiency.

## Results Summary

* Cumulative Rewards: Both PPO and DQN show positive results, with DQN achieving higher, but more variable rewards.
* Stability: PPO demonstrates greater stability and consistency in rewards.
Training Efficiency: PPO trains faster with less variance in rewards.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of RL, particularly the PPO algorithm, in crafting data-driven cryptocurrency trading strategies. It provides a foundation for future research and development in applying advanced RL techniques to the dynamic cryptocurrency market.
